# game
Just a beginner's attempt to create text-based game while learning Python programming.
The plan is that the game will contain several features which I will learn during the process of creating it.
Which are:
1. Conditional statements
2. Functions
3. Classes
4. Working with a database (MySql)
5. Working with Github.
